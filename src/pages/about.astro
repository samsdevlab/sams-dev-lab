		<h1>Yoyo, I'm Sam. Welcome to my Dev Lab!</h1>
	  
		<p>Over 6 months ago, I began my development journey.</p>
	  
		<p>I was a musician for many years and worked a ton of odd jobs to support myself.</p>

		<p>Eventually, I grew tired of that lifestyle and got into IT!</p>

		<p>I was a Help Desk Technician, Account Manager, and SDR in this space before finding web development. Put simply, this is my thing. I love the mesh of creativity and logic and want to remain in this space for decades to come.</p>

		<p>Sam's Dev Lab is a space to showcase my portfolio to my future employer as well as have my own mad scientist lab to experiment with different technologies and work on esoteric projects as my knowledge grows.</p>
